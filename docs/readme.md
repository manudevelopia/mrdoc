## Mr Doc!
Extract your documentation right from the code. This tool represents a way to generate project documentation right from the code

### Motivation
Software documentation is not easy to create, preserve and maintain. A good code does not need to be documented, but… how many times do you work with good code?

This tool aims to generate project software documentation from source code to Markdown format.

Document generation can be included as part of project code compilation and/or deployment

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/manudevelopia/mrdoc/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/manudevelopia/mrdoc/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
